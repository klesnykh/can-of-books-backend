## Professional Pairing Practice

### Logistical

> What hours will you be available to communicate?

mostly during school hours, slack or msg after class

> What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

slack, phone

> How often will you take breaks?

whenever either one of us need it

> What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

ask TA for help and stay longer to get work done

### Cooperative

> Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

Thomas: styling, CSS

Kirill: JavaScript, React

> How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

Have Kirill check on my code, and me check on his CSS

> In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

Thomas: JavaScript

Kirill: better at coding, esp. backend

> Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

putting in comment, check in with each other

### Conflict Resolution

> What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

help each other and get TA for help.

> What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

have predefined roles. one on frontend, the other one on backend.

> How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

checking with each other after every step that we do, to make sure everyone is on the same page
